Hi, I am *Jichen* (Becks), a Finacial Engineer. I grow up in Beijing, China. Currently I live in Florida, US.

I graduated from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champiagn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign) with master degree in [Financial Engineering](https://msfe.illinois.edu/), and I obtained my Bachelor Degree in Economic & Math from [China Agriculture University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Agricultural_University).  

In my spare time, I love learning new technologies, running and watching sports. 

This is me, keep running and keep real.
