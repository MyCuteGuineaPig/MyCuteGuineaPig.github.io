Hi, I'am Becks. I am a quant developer. I grew up in Beijing(a modern, historical city ) and currently live in New York. I have many year experiences in quant development. Based on my experiences, I have developed various automated trading adjustment tools, trading web dashboards, trading pricing engines, monitoring systems and trading synchronization framework which includes both front-end and back-end programs in various languages. Currently in my role, I implement credit analytics statistical machine production algorithms.

My interest includes NLP, machine learning, deep learning applications in financial industry. 

I believe machine learning will have a bright future in financial industry by analyzing millions of data sets within a short time to improve the outcomes without being explicitly programmed
