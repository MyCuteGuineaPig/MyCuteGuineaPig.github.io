## Install ruby, jekyll bundler

#### ruby

```
ruby --version #if version is lower than 2.2, install ruby as below
```

[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

```
brew install chruby ruby-install
ruby-install ruby
```


#### jekyll bundler

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler

# if has below error
# You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0 directory.
# or Could not locate Gemfile
# try 

export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gem"

# then run 
gem install jekyll bundler

```


## Init Bundler

creates a new Bundler project (by creating an empty Gemfile).

```bash
cd documents/github/username.github.io
Bundle init
```

#### Configure Bundler Install Path(optional)

configure Bundler to install gems in the ./vendor/bundle/ project subdirectory. The advantage of doing this is that bundler will install gems within your project folder instead of the location used by gem install. This can help you avoid permissions errors you might otherwise get during gem installation. If you skip this step, Bundler will install your dependencies to the location used by gem install.


```bash
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
```

## Add Jekyll

add Jekyll as a dependency of project. This command will add the Jekyll gem to our Gemfile and install it to the ./vendor/bundle/ folder

```bash
Bundle add jekyll
```
Now Jekyll is installed. We need the `--force` parameter because our folder isnâ€™t empty - it already has some Bundler files in it. run the `bundle install` separately because Jekyll gets confused if the Gemfile already exists.

```bash
bundle exec jekyll new --force --skip-bundle .
bundle install
```


## Serve site

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open browser with [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)


## Git Ignore

want to ignore the `./vendor/` and `./.bundle/` folders since they contain user- or platform-specific information.

```
# Ignore metadata generated by Jekyll
_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata

# Ignore folders generated by Bundler
.bundle/
vendor/
```
