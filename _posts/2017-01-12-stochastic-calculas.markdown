## 1 Stochastic process

In probability theory and related fields, **a stochastic or random process** is a mathematical object usually defined as a family of random variables. Many stochastic processes can be represented by time series. However,<span style="color:red"> a stochastic process is by nature continuous while a time series is a set of observations indexed by integers. A stochastic process may involve several related random variables.</span>


A stochastic process is defined as a collection of random variables defined on a common probability space $$ {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)}$$, where $${\displaystyle \Omega }$$  is a sample space, $${\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}$$ is a $${\displaystyle \sigma }$$-algebra, and $${\displaystyle P}$$ is a probability measure; and the random variables, indexed by some set $${\displaystyle T}$$, all take values in the same mathematical space $${\displaystyle S}$$, which must be measurable with respect to some $${\displaystyle \sigma }$$ -algebra $${\displaystyle \Sigma }$$ .
